## Installation and Usage

To add the package to your Laravel project via Composer:

```bash
composer require gorlabs/tailwind-datatables
```

### Configuration

You can publish the configuration file to modify the package's default settings:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=gorlabs-tailwind-datatables-config
```

This command will copy the config/gorlabs-tailwind-datatables.php file to your project.

### Asset Publishing (If Needed)

To publish the package's CSS files to your project's resources/css directory (to include in your own Tailwind pipeline):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tailwind-datatables-css
```
This command will copy the published CSS files under resources/css. You will need to import these files in your own resources/css/app.css file. A separate publishing command is not required for JavaScript files; they can be imported directly from the vendor directory.
## Example Projects
You can examine our ready-to-use example projects to see how the package works with Livewire, Vue.js, and React stacks. These projects are full-fledged Laravel applications demonstrating the installation and basic usage of the package.
